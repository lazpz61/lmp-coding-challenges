This is a compilation of the coding challenges in which I've successfuly solved.

The intention for this is to continue sharpening my skillset and problem solving abilities

as well as having a repository so that I can share for future reference to anyone learning how to code and needing to understand the solution that I've chosen.

Within each challenge and solution I've written down my thought processes as well as what I thought to be an effective solution to implement for the problems.
